      <h4 className="mb-5 mt-5">What is Soft Washing?</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Soft washing is an alternative to pressure washing. It is a gentle
        cleaning process used to remove organic growth and stains from the
        exterior of homes and commercial buildings.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        This is done by using a combination of bleach (sodium hypochlorite) and
        soap (surfactant), which is sprayed onto the building at only 60 PSI.
        After the mixture sits for a few minutes it is rinsed off with plain
        water.

      <h4 className="mb-5 mt-5">Why not Pressure Wash?</h4>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Commercial pressure washing equipment can exceed 4000 PSI. This type of
        pressure can easily cause damage to a home. There are specific
        situations where pressure washers work much better. On hard surfaces
        such as concrete driveways, high pressure is needed and there is no risk
        in damage.
